## About the book: Tao of React
You could find the [☁️ 📖 Online version here](https://alexkondov.com/tao-of-react/). Or buy it [here](https://www.taoofreact.com/) which I recommend you should. I remind author's introduction. 


> Tao of React is for beginners who want to advance further in their knowledge. The best time to read it is when you've grasped the fundamentals and are starting to build real applications.

You should read this after couple months to a year of using react. It won't bring more value to the fresher, but when familar with react, the book will help you advance your react code. I don't mean all the things in this book are the best practices. The author just gave some recommendations for each topic, and including the pros and cons, or reasoning on which is good in which case. Besides, the book also focus on organizing code, balancing testing - things I belive are the key differences between senior and junior mindset. The book are easy to read and adapt, even with a backend dev like me.

## Take away

I just note some take away to make the longer 😜 for a full experience, you should try it yourself. 

* I love the idea react component should be simple and focus on rendering, split helpers. Let's the custom hook control the logic behind. Therefor, the code of component will be simply straightforward, like the [Confident ruby](https://pragprog.com/titles/agcr/confident-ruby/), the code should be like story telling: State, logic, condition, render.
* Testing 🤓 the book pointed out the differences between logic-focus testing (on backend) and UI-focus testing (on frontend), and suggest the balanced approaching for good amount of both, to achieve the main goal: quality.
* Use loops and configuration objects - yes, simple, but I have to review this smell over and over.
