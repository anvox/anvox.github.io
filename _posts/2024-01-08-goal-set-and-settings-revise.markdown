## Set and Setting

Revise some goal setting related

### Why?

Why do we set goals? Why do we need to follow up?<br />
Having goals is a good way to focus attention on the things that are important. It allows us to create a vision of how we would like our life to be. When we have a goal, we tend to increase the amount of time and effort we spend on an activity, and develop effective strategies to achieve that goal.

### What is a good goal?

Some questions to concern:

* Does goal SMART enough? I usually convern of measureable, to me, it's the most important to achieve.
* Does it an OKR goal?
* The objective 100% in our control or not? "Being a senior developer" is different from "Exhibit behavior of senior developer"
* Goal could be break into checklist?
* How do we track goal progress?
* Action is recurring or one off?
* Is it feeling, like: "Confident to present in a meeting"?
* Does it align with company goals?
* Does it align with personal growth or hobbies: Mental health, physic health, networkings, social...?
* Which changes will help you significant improve?
* What blocked you from moving faster, better in daily tasks?

Remember: There's no right or wrong, chose which is helpful.

### How?

Get started with your **focus area**, look back last incompleted goals. Some questions need to answer:

* What will I be in next 1 year? 5 years?
* What which role/position I want to be in next 1 year? 3 year?
* What do I want to be celebrating in next 1 year?
* On the road to achieve X, how close am I to the destination?
