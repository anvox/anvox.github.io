TIL, Immutable doesn't mean slow

In elixir, to add an item to list, we write like this

```elixir
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [0 | list1]
```

If it was me, I have 2 options to implement: clone `list1` or point `list1` to `list1`. Seems, cloning `list1` is prefered, after lots of pain with data changed in ruby ðŸ˜‚ 
But if creating `list2` clones `list1`, it'll be slow. Memory consumed, time for GC... Chosing pointing, what if `list1` changed?

Wait!

`elixir` is immutable, that means, `list1` isn't changed, that means, we needn't care about breaking `list2` in this way.

Another point is, elixir list is linked list. So, it's native faster to implement the pointing way.
